                <p>Description: Roblox is one of the most popular online game platforms to play and create one’s own
                games. Roblox helps students socialize and expand their analytical and problem-solving
                skills while having fun with their friends. The games are easy to interact with, even for
                young children. In this course students will be introduced to concepts around game
                construction, with an introduction to Roblox Studio, where they can generate a random
                world or build on pre-fabricated themes, templates and storylines. In this course, students
                will also learn about Digital Citizenship, Internet Security, and other critical concepts and
                develop habits and practices for safe online interactions with others.</p></div>
